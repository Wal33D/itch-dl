## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "You did not provide an API key"

- Get your API key from
  [itch.io API Keys](https://itch.io/user/settings/api-keys)
- Pass it with `--api-key YOUR_KEY` or set `ITCH_API_KEY` environment variable

#### "TypeError: data.owned*keys is not iterable" *(Fixed in v0.6.4)\_

- This was resolved in version 0.6.4
- Update to the latest version: `npm update -g itch-dl`

#### Empty results for my-purchases

- This is normal if you haven't purchased any games on itch.io
- Free games need to be downloaded individually by URL

#### Collection downloads fail

- Ensure the collection is public
- Private collections require you to be the owner or have access

#### Network timeouts

- Use `--parallel 1` to reduce concurrent requests
- Check your internet connection and try again

### 🧪 Help Wanted: Testing
